                About ONJA.
            </h2>
            <h4 style="color: black">
                I'm studying at ONJA school, which is a NGO lead by SAM and located in
                Mahanoro. We are twenty students at ONJA, to learn english and coding
                with seven staff. This organisation is based on supporting the student
                who can't go to university but still want to study.We studyed english
                last year up to now, but this year we focus more on coding.

                At the beginning of my study.
            </h2>
            <h4 style="color: black">
                Generally, I really love studying because I want to learn many
                things. As far as I'm concerned, study assists me to have a better
                life in the future as many students want. That's what I'm doing now.
                However, at the beginning, I found it really hard to get started and to get
                use to it, but in fact working hard pushed me to get over that. That's why,
                I admit that nothing is easy on earth without
                trying hard. Apart from that I had to change many things, including
                the way of studying. Moreover, I needed to set up a new method of managing
                time so that I can use my time wisely.

                At this time, my study is getting better. Thanks to all sophisticated
                staff at ONJA because without them I would never be on tihis stage now.
                 Thank you very much for devoting yourself to reading my blog.
