        About ONJA.
    </h3>
        I'm studying at ONJA school, which is a NGO lead by SAM and located in
         Mahanoro. We are twenty students at ONJA, also, this organisation is
         based on supporting the student who can't go to university to learn
         english and coding.We studyed english last up to now, but this year we
         focus more about coding.

    <h3>
        At the beginning of my study.
    </h3>

<p>
    Generally, I really love studying because I want to learn many
     things. As far as I'm concerned, study assists me to have a better
     life in the future as many students want. That's what I'm doing now.
     However, at the beginning, I found it really hard to get started and to get
     use to it, but in fact practice pushed me to get over that. That's why,
     I admit that nothing is easy on earth without
     trying hard. Apart from that I had to change many things, including
     the way of studying. Moreover, I needed to set up a new method of managing
     time so that I can use my time wisely.
