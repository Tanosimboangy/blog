            I don't have a large family but I'm really glad to tell you about them. My father is Francois Valentin Jacquit. He is from Toliara, in the south of Madagascar, and born there. He is a farmer. My mother's name is Rasoarinjaina Fanjarivelina and she is from Amparafaravola, in Alaotra Mangoro region. She is a teacher since 2008 until now and teaching in small village called Maromandia at the moment, about 8km from Andilamena. Because of this location, she has to walk for two hours and half to go toand from this place.

Franco is eighteen, my first brother, who is studying at the university now. Francisca is sixteen, the second and he is studying in high school, but my third brother called Francio is eleven, still in the middle school. My first sister is seven, called Francia, still in the primary school with my last brother called Vatosoa, who is five years old. Stellah is my last sister, born the same date as mine. That's all about my siblings.
